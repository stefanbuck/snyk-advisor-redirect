# snyk Advisor Redirect

Chrome extension to redirect npmjs.com/packages/* requests to [Snyk's Open Source Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/)!

## Example

A request made to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/react` will automatically to `https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/react`.


## Why

The Snyk Advisor gives you an overall package health score along with other useful information around popularity, maintenance, security, released versions, and other useful data points. This gives you the information they need to make informed decisions about which packages to include in your project.

## Install

[Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snyk-advisor-redirect/ofdkpchoknncbogonnkggilplgpjmlba)
